# ECharts Visualization with Flask Integration

This repository demonstrates the process of generating dynamic visualizations using ECharts, based on data prepared in Python, with Flask serving as the web framework to deliver the content.

## Prerequisites

- **Python & Flask**: For data generation and web server functionality.
- **Web Browser**: To display the visualization.

## Overview

1. **Data Generation**: Utilize Python to create a dataset.
2. **Flask Application**: A Flask app serves an HTML page that employs ECharts for data visualization. The chart's color changes dynamicallyâ€”red indicates positive values, and blue indicates negative values.

## Steps to Run

- Start the Flask application.
- Navigate to the provided URL in your web browser to view the chart.

## Customization and Usage

The project allows for significant customization. Users are encouraged to modify the Python data generation script and the ECharts configuration to suit their specific requirements.
